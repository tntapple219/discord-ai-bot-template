# ü§ñ Discord AI Chatbot Template

---

A highly customizable Discord AI chatbot template built with `discord.py` and `openai` (compatible with OpenAI-like APIs). This template features **API key rotation for improved reliability** and **dynamic, per-user conversation history management** with a configurable system prompt.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Discord Integration**: Connects to your Discord server and responds to slash commands.
* **AI Chat Functionality**: Uses `openai` library to interact with various AI models (via OpenRouter.ai or other compatible APIs).
* **API Key Rotation**: Automatically switches to another API key if the current one fails, enhancing bot uptime and reliability.
* **Per-User Conversation History**: Maintains separate chat histories for each user, allowing for natural and continuous conversations.
* **Configurable AI Personality**: Easily define the AI's persona and instructions via an environment variable.
* **Flexible API Endpoint**: Switch between different OpenAI-compatible API services (like OpenRouter.ai, OpenAI's official API, etc.) by changing an environment variable.
* **Command to Reset History**: Users can clear their personal conversation history with a simple slash command.
* **Secure Configuration**: Utilizes `.env` files for managing sensitive information like tokens and API keys.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Follow these steps to get your AI chatbot up and running!

### 1. Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+**: Make sure you have Python installed.
* **Discord Bot Token**: Create a new bot application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), enable `Message Content Intent` and `Privileged Gateway Intents` (under Bot -> Privileged Gateway Intents), and copy your bot token.
* **OpenRouter.ai API Keys**: Get your API keys from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) or any other OpenAI-compatible API service.

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the `bot.py` file and create a `.env` file manually):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tntapple219/discord-ai-bot-template.git
    cd discord-ai-bot-template
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install discord.py openai python-dotenv
    ```

### 3. Configuration

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the same directory as `bot.py`.
2.  **Add your configuration** to the `.env` file. Here's a template:

    ```ini
    # .env example
    # Discord Bot Token (REQUIRED!)
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"

    # OpenRouter.ai API Keys (comma-separated if you have multiple)
    # Get them from [https://openrouter.ai/](https://openrouter.ai/)
    OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEYS="sk-yourkey1,sk-yourkey2,sk-yourkey3" 

    # AI Model Name (optional, defaults to google/gemma-3-27b-it:free)
    # Check available models on OpenRouter.ai: [https://openrouter.ai/docs#models](https://openrouter.ai/docs#models)
    AI_MODEL_NAME="google/gemma-3-27b-it:free"

    # The System Prompt / AI's Personality (REQUIRED for bot personality!)
    # This sets the AI's core instructions and persona.
    # Example: "You are a helpful AI assistant."
    # Example: "You are a friendly, sarcastic chatbot who loves to make jokes."
    AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT="You are a helpful and friendly AI assistant. Your goal is to provide useful information and and engage in pleasant conversation."

    # AI API Base URL (optional, defaults to OpenRouter.ai's API URL)
    # Use this if you want to connect to a different OpenAI-compatible API endpoint
    # Example for OpenAI's official API: [https://api.openai.com/v1](https://api.openai.com/v1)
    AI_API_BASE_URL="[https://openrouter.ai/api/v1](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1)" 
    ```
    *Replace the placeholder values with your actual tokens and keys.*

### 4. Run the Bot

Execute the `bot.py` file:
```bash
python bot.py
````

Your bot should now connect to Discord\!

-----

## ‚ö° Usage

Once the bot is online and slash commands are synced (this happens automatically when the bot starts), you can use the following commands in your Discord server:

  * `/chat <your_message>`: Ask the AI a question and start a conversation.
  * `/reset`: Clear your personal conversation history with the bot.
